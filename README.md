# Maine Wildfire Mapping
### September 2023

This project analyzes wildfire data from the state of Maine for the year 2022. 
It uses the GeoPandas library to create three different outputs to help visualize the data in different ways.
These have been included in the repo in the outputs folder as .png images.
To view the explorable map, please download the fires_explore.html file to your computer and open it in your internet browser.
